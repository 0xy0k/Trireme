# Trireme: A Pioneer in The New Era of DeFi

Trireme introduces a groundbreaking hybrid Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) platform that innovatively combines the capabilities of both NFTs and Yield-Bearing Tokens. The platform allows users to borrow against both NFTs and Yield-Bearing Tokens, providing unparalleled flexibility and liquidity in the digital asset space. In addition to the core CDP functionality, the project offers a suite of utilities designed to enhance user experience and asset value.

## Core Features

### Hybrid CDP Platform:

- Borrowing Against NFTs and Yield-Bearing Tokens: Users can use their NFTs and Yield-Bearing Tokens as collateral to secure loans, unlocking liquidity without relinquishing ownership of their valuable digital assets.

- Dynamic Collateral Management: Helios supports a wide array of both NFTs and Yield-Bearing Tokens, ensuring users can maximize their assets' potential.

### Agora Bonds:

- Enhanced Yield Opportunities: Users can participate in our bonding mechanism, providing liquidity to the platform in exchange for attractive returns. This feature ensures a steady supply of capital and rewards participants with competitive yields.

### Trireme-Pegged NFTs:

- Innovative Incentives: Trireme introduces a unique pegged model for NFTs, where users can burn Trireme tokens to earn guardian NFTs that emit rewards. This mechanism not only adds value to NFT holdings but also creates a deflationary effect, increasing the scarcity and value of remaining tokens. The NFTs may also be borrowed against in Helios, allowing for a complete loop within our ecosystem.
